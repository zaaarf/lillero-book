# The Lillero Book
This is meant as an in-depth guide to ASM manipulation with the [Lillero](https://github.com/zaaarf/lillero) framework. While that's the main focus, it's written to also be useful to anyone wanting to learn ASM patching in general. Some parts (which will be flagged appropriately) may be applicable to Minecraft alone, but most of the book is meant to be generic.
