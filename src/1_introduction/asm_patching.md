# An introduction to ASM patching
ASM patching means, in short, to modify the "ASM" - that is, "assembly" - of an application at runtime. Within Java, this refers to the bytecode, which is the lower-level language your Java code gets compiled to. Due to the radical nature of modifying the game, before writing a patch one should always wonder whether patching is the correct approach. That is not to say that there is never a need for patching: you should just know that many problems can be solved by other means.

Though reviled by many, ASM patching remains one of the most powerful tools at your disposal when modding a game. Like every tool, ASM patching is not evil in itself, rather it depends on how one uses it; when used correctly, it can solve just about any problem elegantly and with the lowest possible footprint; when done incorrectly, it can wreak havoc on the entire environment, causing inexplicable crashes and odd incompatibilities.
