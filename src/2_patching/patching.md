# Patching
Since you are applying changes to the bytecode of a class, this must necessarily happen before said class is loaded in memory. The component that applies said changes is called a *loader*; don't concern yourself on the inner workings of loaders for now, just know that they are in charge of the initial step: we'll cover them in detail in their own chapter.

Suppose that you already have a working loader in place. This loader calls your *injector method*, and passes it a [`ClassNode`](https://asm.ow2.io/javadoc/org/objectweb/asm/tree/ClassNode.html) and a [`MethodNode`](https://asm.ow2.io/javadoc/org/objectweb/asm/tree/MethodNode.html) as arguments, representing respectively the container class and the method you're targeting. This is the most common type of ASM patching, and it's probably why you're here; more advanced subjects may be covered in additional chapters later on.

At a glance, this might seem restrictive. However, do keep in mind that even code outside of methods - in field declarations, in loose blocks, or in `static` blocks - is actually considered to be part of a method by the compiler. Specifically, the constructor (`<init>`) for instance fields and loose blocks, and the static constructor (`<clinit>`) for static fields and `static` blocks.
